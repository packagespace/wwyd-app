one:
  title: "Riichi Book 1: 2-away vs 1-away"
  hand: 5677m34p45579s666z
  solution: 7m4s
  explanation: "Discarding 9s makes the hand 2-away, whereas discarding either 7m
  or 4s makes the hand 1-away. You should thus discard 7m or 4s to
  make the hand 1-away. Reverting a 1-away hand to 2-away makes
  sense only in some exceptional cases where tile acceptance at 1-away
  becomes unbearably small (i.e., fewer than 2 kinds). With this hand,
  the hand will be able to accept 25p8s (3 kindsâ€“12 tiles) when it
  becomes 1-away."
